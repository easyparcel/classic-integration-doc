---

## Introduction
This guide walks you through setting up live shipping rates at checkout in your Shopify store using the EasyParcel Shopify App. The system calculates shipping costs automatically based on destination and cart weight, enabling real-time rate choices for customers.

## Before You Get Started
You must be on Shopify **Grow (annual billing)**, **Advanced** or **Plus** plan to enable live rates at checkout.  
If you're on the Shopify **Grow (monthly billing)** plan, you'll either need to:
- Add this feature to your plan (for an extra monthly fee), or  
- Switch to annual billing to activate it.  
For more assistance, please reach out to **Shopify Support**.
