**Console debugging:**
- Check for JavaScript errors

**Additional debugging tips:**
- Inspect the element to know the details (class name, id) of element added by our plugin, as a key to find where this element is added in our code
- Edit the code at "Plugin File Editor" under "Tools" or "Plugins" tab
- Add the logs using:
  - JS: `console.log()`
  - PHP: `echo/print_r`
  - Use properly as it may affect the front end of the website.
  - WooCommerce env with php: `wc_get_logger()->debug();`
- Get the log at "WooCommerce" -> "Status" -> "Logs". If the log is added to our plugin, the name of the log file would be in format: "plugin-easyparcel-woocommerce-plugin-vX-X-X-X"

<summary><strong>Q: How is the item with volumetric weight is calculated</strong></summary>

**How We Handle Package Dimensions for Multiple Items**

When processing orders with multiple items, we don't simply add up all the dimensions. Instead, we use a **smart packaging algorithm** that optimizes the final package size to avoid excessive volumetric weight charges.

**Our Dimension Calculation Logic:**

**For each item in the order:**
- We track both the **maximum** dimension and **sum** of dimensions for length, width, and height
- Each dimension is converted to centimeters and validated

**Smart Packaging Algorithm:**

We calculate three sums: sumLength, sumWidth, sumHeight
Then we find the smallest sum among these three
Final dimensions are determined as:
- If sumLength is smallest → Use: sumLength × maxWidth × maxHeight
- If sumWidth is smallest → Use: maxLength × sumWidth × maxHeight  
- If sumHeight is smallest → Use: maxLength × maxWidth × sumHeight

**Why This Approach?**

**Problem:** Simply adding all dimensions (L+L+L, W+W+W, H+H+H) would create unrealistically large packages and result in very high volumetric weight charges.

**Solution:** Our algorithm assumes items can be packed efficiently by:
- **Stacking** along the smallest total dimension
- **Using the largest single item size** for the other two dimensions

**Example:**

If you order 3 identical boxes (10cm × 5cm × 3cm each):
- Simple sum would be: 30cm × 15cm × 9cm = 4,050 cm³
- Our smart algorithm: 30cm × 5cm × 3cm = 450 cm³ *(stacking along length)*

This represents realistic packaging where items are stacked efficiently, resulting in more accurate shipping costs and better customer experience.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **Lower shipping costs** due to realistic volumetric weight
- ✅ **Accurate courier quotations**
- ✅ **Efficient packaging** recommendations
- ✅ **Prevents overcharging** customers

**Basically:**
W/L/H = width length height
Smallest sum of either W/L/H × the largest W/L/H × the W/L/H

<details>
<summary><strong>Q: If wants to split 1 order into few shipment</strong></summary>

We recommend that sellers use this plugin. However, we advise them to mark up their shipping fees. This is because the plugin cannot collect multiple shipping fees from buyers, and the order can only be split once the buyer has completed the payment.

<summary><strong>Q: Will order fulfill status changed after the order is fulfilled in WooCommerce?</strong></summary>

When importing an order to the EP dashboard and fulfilling it, the order status in WooCommerce will not update to "complete." The order status will be updated to "complete" only when the order is fulfilled in WooCommerce.

If the customer's EP credit is not enough, the order could not be made and the status will not be updated. Additionally, if the customer pays for the order shipping on the EP dashboard, the order status will not be updated to "Complete" automatically. The customer will need to manually change the status.
