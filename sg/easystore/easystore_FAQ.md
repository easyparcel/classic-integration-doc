<summary><strong>Address and Import Issues</strong></summary>



### Why my EasyStore order parcel content is not the same as their product name
You may set their parcel content value in the SiteGiant settings. The reason why we don't directly take the product name as parcel content is because it may exceed a maximum of 35 characters when calling our API.

<summary><strong>Shipping Options</strong></summary>

### Too many shipping options at checkout - customers request preferred/selected shipping options
**Issue:** Currently unable to filter or select 1 specific courier during checkout

**Solution:** Customer can disable EasyParcel rate and setup selected courier. Orders can still be fulfilled using EasyParcel Malaysia service.

**Reference:** [Set up selected courier service by disabling EasyParcel rate](https://support.easystore.co/en/article/set-up-selected-courier-service-by-disabling-easyparcel-rate-1dy3s9k/#2-1-reason-of-the-many-courier-services-at-checkout-page)

### "Address provided is out of shipping zone. Please choose a different delivery address or contact us."
Check their **Shipping & Pickup** in settings. They probably did not setup to handle the address in shipping zones.
